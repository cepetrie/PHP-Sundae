Built a PHP page that uses a form to allow clients to build their own sundae and select toppings. 

Once the user has ordered their sundae, produced output similar to this:

You ordered a sundae with chocolate, pineapple and peanuts

Note the placement of the word AND. The word "and" is added (or removed) depending on the choices of the customer.  
No comma is allowed just before the word "and".

The form handles any number of toppings, including none.

If the customer orders no toppings, provided feedback.
